# Computational-Geoscience

This GitHub repository presents educational or exploratory Jupyter notebooks covering various computational geoscience techniques such as PCA, regression, flow modeling, and geostatistical methods like variogram kriging. Also there are some javascripts code for image classification and visualization in Google Earth Engine. The scripts are self-contained and suitable for learning or reference purposes.
